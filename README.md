# Vaccine Hesitancy Theme Classification with BERT

## Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning project aimed at identifying and classifying key themes of vaccine hesitancy using the BERT model. Our approach utilizes a multi-label classification technique to analyze textual data, helping to uncover the underlying sentiments and concerns related to vaccines.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to better understand public sentiment towards vaccines by identifying various themes of vaccine hesitancy in social media discourse. Using the BERT model, a powerful tool in natural language processing, we classify text into multiple labels that represent different aspects of hesitancy towards vaccinations.

## File Descriptions
- `bert-hpv-taxonomy.py` - The main Python script that uses the BERT model for multi-label classification of vaccine hesitancy themes.

## Requirements
To run this code, you will need the following:
- Python 3.8 or later
- PyTorch
- Transformers library by Hugging Face
- Pandas
- Numpy
